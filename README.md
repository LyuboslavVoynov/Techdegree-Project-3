# Techdegree-Project-3

In this project, you'll create an interactive registration form for "FullStack Conf." Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll use JavaScript to enhance the form by adding interactivity. You’ll also make the form more user-friendly by providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. You can use plain JavaScript or jQuery –– it's up to you!
